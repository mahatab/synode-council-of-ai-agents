Synode is a desktop app for **macOS and Windows** that assembles a **council of AI models** to collaboratively tackle your questions. Multiple models from different providers discuss the topic - either sequentially (building on each other) or independently (preventing groupthink) - then a **master model** synthesizes everything into a clear, actionable verdict. You can also switch to **Direct Chat** mode for 1-on-1 conversations with any individual model.

## How It Works
<img src="docs/images/pixel-art-flowchart.jpg" alt="Pixel art flowchart showing how Synode works: a user asks a question at the top, five AI council models discuss it sequentially in the middle, a crowned master model delivers the final verdict below, and a looping arrow with an @ symbol shows that users can follow up with any model afterward."/>

You ask a question, and your council of AI models responds. In **Sequential** mode (as shown above), each model sees the full discussion so far, responding one by one. In **Independent** mode, each model only sees your original question and responds **in parallel** for faster results and unbiased perspectives. Once everyone has weighed in, a master model synthesizes all perspectives into a clear, actionable verdict. After the verdict, @mention any model to ask follow-up questions with full context.

## Features

### Two Modes
- **Council Mode** — assemble a panel of AI models for collaborative discussion and a synthesized verdict
- **Direct Chat** — 1-on-1 conversations with any of 29+ models across 8 cloud providers and local models, with multi-turn history and streaming

### Council Discussion
- **8 cloud providers + local models** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Together AI, Cohere, and LM Studio
- **Discussion styles** — Sequential (each model builds on previous responses) or Independent (each model responds without seeing others, preventing groupthink)
- **Parallel execution** — In Independent mode, models 1..N stream their responses simultaneously for faster results, with a real-time Council Progress overlay tracking each model's status
- **Master verdict** — a designated model synthesizes all opinions into a final recommendation

### Direct Chat
- **Agent picker** — searchable grid of all available models, sorted by API key availability
- **Multi-turn conversations** — full conversation history with streaming responses
- **Auto-save** — sessions are saved after every response with AI-generated titles
- **Provider color coding** — each model is visually identified by its provider

### Follow-Up @Mentions ![Council Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Council_Mode-orange)
- After the verdict, type **`@`** to mention any council member or the master model
- Ask follow-up questions with **full discussion context** — the model sees every response, not just its own
- Cross-reference freely: *"@Grok what do you think about GPT's suggestion?"*
- Chain unlimited follow-ups within the same session

### Smart Prompt Engineering ![Council Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Council_Mode-orange)
- **Upfront mode** — master generates tailored system prompts for all council members before the discussion starts
- **Dynamic mode** — master generates a custom prompt for each model right before its turn, incorporating context from previous responses

### Discussion Depth ![Council Mode](https://img.shields.io/badge/Council_Mode-orange)
- **Thorough** — detailed analysis with comprehensive reasoning
- **Concise** — 2-3 key points per model, optimized for speed and cost
- Active settings are always visible in the chat view with (i) tooltips explaining each option

### Session Management
- Auto-save after every response — never lose a discussion
- AI-generated session titles
- Searchable history grouped by date
- Custom storage location

### Token Usage & Cost Tracking
- Per-model input/output token counts
- **Estimated USD cost** per model and grand total, powered by [tokentally](https://github.com/steipete/tokentally) with static pricing for all 29 models
- Dedicated **Usage tab** in Settings — separates read-only analytics from editable model configuration
- Summary stat cards showing total tokens, total cost, and models used at a glance

### Telegram Bot Integration
- **Built-in Telegram bot** — chat with Synode from any device
- **Council and Direct Chat** — both modes available via `/council` and `/chat` commands
- **Shared config** — uses the same API keys, models, and settings as the desktop app
- **Auto-start** — bot launches with the app when enabled in Settings
- See [Telegram Bot docs](docs/TELEGRAM_BOT.md) for setup instructions

### Internet Access (Web Search)
- **Live web search** — models can search the web for up-to-date information when answering
- **4 supported providers** — Anthropic (`web_search` tool), Google (`google_search` grounding), OpenAI (Responses API), xAI (Responses API, Grok-4 only)
- **Automatic model filtering** — unsupported providers (DeepSeek, Mistral, Together AI, Cohere) are excluded from council when internet is enabled, with amber warnings showing which models are skipped
- **Globe toggle** — enable/disable from the chat input area or Advanced Settings
- **Smart prompting** — system prompt nudge instructs models to actively use their search tools
- **Telegram bot support** — web search works in Telegram council and direct chat when enabled in desktop settings

### Local Models (LM Studio)
- **Run models locally** — use any model from LM Studio alongside cloud providers, free, private, and offline
- **Dedicated settings tab** — setup guide, server status monitoring, base URL configuration, and dynamic model discovery
- **No API key required** — Synode connects to your local LM Studio server automatically
- **Full integration** — local models work in Council Mode, Direct Chat, and Telegram bot with a green "Local" badge for clear identification
- **Mix and match** — combine local and cloud models in the same council discussion

### Polished UX
- **Real-time streaming** with 4 animated cursor styles (ripple, breathing, orbit, multi-caret)
- **Dark mode** support
- **Drag-and-drop** model reordering
- **Secure API key storage** — macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager
- **Setup wizard** with built-in API key instructions for each provider
- **External links** — URLs in model responses open in the system default browser
