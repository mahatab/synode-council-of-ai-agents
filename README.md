Synod is a desktop app for **macOS and Windows** that assembles a **council of AI models** to collaboratively tackle your questions. Multiple models from different providers discuss the topic - either sequentially (building on each other) or independently (preventing groupthink) - then a **master model** synthesizes everything into a clear, actionable verdict.

## How It Works
<img src="docs/images/pixel-art-flowchart.jpg" alt="Pixel art flowchart showing how Synod works: a user asks a question at the top, five AI council models discuss it sequentially in the middle, a crowned master model delivers the final verdict below, and a looping arrow with an @ symbol shows that users can follow up with any model afterward."/>

You ask a question, and your council of AI models responds one by one. In **Sequential** mode (as shown above), each model sees the full discussion so far. In **Independent** mode, each model only sees your original question, giving you unbiased perspectives. Once everyone has weighed in, a master model synthesizes all perspectives into a clear, actionable verdict. After the verdict, @mention any model to ask follow-up questions with full context.

## Features

### Council Discussion
- **8 providers, 30 models** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Together AI, and Cohere
- **Discussion styles** — Sequential (each model builds on previous responses) or Independent (each model responds without seeing others, preventing groupthink)
- **Master verdict** — a designated model synthesizes all opinions into a final recommendation
- **Clarifying questions** — the first council member can ask up to 2 clarifying questions before proceeding

### Follow-Up @Mentions
- After the verdict, type **`@`** to mention any council member or the master model
- Ask follow-up questions with **full discussion context** — the model sees every response, not just its own
- Cross-reference freely: *"@Grok what do you think about GPT's suggestion?"*
- Chain unlimited follow-ups within the same session

### Smart Prompt Engineering
- **Upfront mode** — master generates tailored system prompts for all council members before the discussion starts
- **Dynamic mode** — master generates a custom prompt for each model right before its turn, incorporating context from previous responses

### Discussion Depth
- **Thorough** — detailed analysis with comprehensive reasoning
- **Concise** — 2-3 key points per model, optimized for speed and cost
- Active settings are always visible in the chat view with (i) tooltips explaining each option

### Session Management
- Auto-save after every response — never lose a discussion
- AI-generated session titles
- Searchable history grouped by date
- Custom storage location

### Token Usage Tracking
- Per-model input/output token counts
- Aggregated usage stats in Settings
- System prompt generation tokens tracked separately

### Polished UX
- **Real-time streaming** with 4 animated cursor styles (ripple, breathing, orbit, multi-caret)
- **Dark, light, and system themes** with smooth transitions
- **Drag-and-drop** model reordering
- **Secure API key storage** — macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager
- **Setup wizard** with built-in API key instructions for each provider
- Native window with overlay title bar

## Supported Providers

| Provider | Models |
|----------|--------|
| **Anthropic** | Claude Opus 4.6, Sonnet 4.6, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5 |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-5.2, GPT-5.2 Pro, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 Mini, GPT-4.1 Nano, GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, o3, o3-mini, o4-mini |
| **Google** | Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite |
| **xAI** | Grok-4, Grok-3, Grok-3 Mini |

| **Cohere** | Command A, Command R+ |

> Bring your own API keys. Each key is stored locally in the OS credential store (macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager) — never sent anywhere except the provider's own API.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** 10.15+ or **Windows** 10+
- **Rust** 1.77+ &mdash; [install via rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Node.js** 18+ &mdash; [download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Tauri CLI** v2 &mdash; `cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2"`

### Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahatab/Council-of-AI-Agents.git
cd Council-of-AI-Agents
npm install
cargo tauri dev
```

A setup wizard will guide you through configuring your council models and API keys on first launch.

## Building

```bash
cargo tauri build
```

**macOS** — produces `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Synod.app` and `.dmg`

**Windows** — produces `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/Synod_x.x.x_x64-setup.exe` and `.msi`

An Xcode project (`CouncilOfAIAgents.xcodeproj`) is also included with dev and build schemes for macOS.
